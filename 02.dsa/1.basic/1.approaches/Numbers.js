/*
=> Some important mathematical formulas
    1) Binomial Coefficient : (n!/(r!(n-r)!))

    2) Perfect Number :- 
        Sum of number of its proper divisor is equal to that number 
        (e.g. 6 => 1 + 2 + 3 == 6 ..etc)
    
    3) Strong Number:- 
        A strong number is equal to the sum of factorial of its digits
        i.e.  (145 = 1! + 4! + 5! == 1 + 24 + 120 == 145)
    
    4) Armstrong number: - 
       An Armstrong number is the sum of the power of the digits with the total number 
       of digits. 
          example 1: 
                xyz -> number of digits is 3
	            power(x,3) + power(y,3) + power(z,3) 
          example 2: 
          wxyz  -> number of digits is 4
	      power(w,4) + power(x,4) + power(y,4) + power(z,4);

    5)  ‘A’ -> 65, ‘Z’ -> 90, ‘a’-> 97, ‘z’-> 128, ‘0’(Zero)-> 48, ’9’-> 57
    7)  Each character is of 1 byte (8 bits) 

    8)  0, '', false, null, undefined and NaN value is treated as false in javascript 
        while any non-zero value is treated as true.

    9)  1 Byte is minimum size of the bucket that is why boolean always consume 1 byte 
        memory instead of 1 bit (0 or 1)
            e.g is_delete = true;

    10) Prime Number : - divided by 1 or self
        e.g 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 ..etc
        30 -> 
        2  * 15 = 30
        3  * 10 = 30
        5  * 6  = 30
        (a)  (b) --> here a is smaller divisor and b is bigger divisor 
        -> we only need to check the number in "sqrt(n)" not in "n"
        -> function isPrime(int n){
            for(int i=2 i*i<=n; i++){
                if(n%i == 0){
                    return false
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
        ->  T.C = O(sqrt(n)) : is not not better than O(LogN)

/*
=> Gray Code:
    -   Gray code is used in many applications because it reduces the likelihood of errors and 
        simplifies logic operations.

=> Uses of gray code:
    -   Digital communications: Gray code helps correct errors in digital communications like cable TV and 
        digital terrestrial television.

    -   Engineering: Gray code is used in applications that require high precision and reliability, such as 
        robotics, digital signal processing, and error correction.

    -   Electromechanical switches: Gray code prevents spurious (false, although seeming to be genuine) 
        output from electromechanical switches. 

=> Binary To Gray conversion
    -   (B1B2B3B4)(Binary Code) = (B1(B1^B2)(B2^B3)(B3^B4)) (Gray Code)
    -   here '^' is xor
    
=> Gray to Binary conversion:
    -   (G1G2G3)(Gray Code) = (G1(G1+G2)(G1+G2+G3))(Binary code)

=> LCM and HCF(GCD):
    -   LCM (Least common multiplication)
        A = 20
        B = 3
        Here LCM is 60 because only 60 can be divisible by both 20 and 3.

    -   HCF (Highest common factor) or GCD (Greatest common divisor)
        A = 12
        B = 15 
        Here GCD will be 3 because 3 is common divisor of both 12 and 15 and it greatest one.

    -   LCM(a, b) = a * b/ GCD(a,b);
    -   LCM(a, b) * GCD(a,b) = a * b;

    -> GCD(Euclidean Algorithm):
        1) Given two numbers a & b, where a >= b. 
            Repeatedly divide a by b;
        2) If remainder r is equal to zero then b would be the gcd.
        3) If remainder is not equal to zero then replace a by b and set b to 
            remainder r.
        4) Then repeat the step 1
        // Sudo Code:
            while(a>=b){
                r = a % b;
