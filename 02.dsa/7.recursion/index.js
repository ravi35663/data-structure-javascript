    -   This pattern is designed to break large data sets into smaller chunks and repeat the 
        process for subsets of data.
    -   This pattern tremendously decreases the time complexity.
    -   Few examples are: 
        binary search, quick sort, merge sort ..etc

=> Recursion : -
	-   A function calls itself to find the desired result .
	-   There is always a base condition with recursion where it stops calling itself and returns 
        the initial result and based on that initial result the actual result will be printed.

    -   When a function is called then that function is pushed into the call stack.
    -   Once the function is executed then that function pops off from the call stack. In the 
        stack everything is moved from top of the stack.

    -   Recursion works in depth first manner (i.e. first last call happens then others)

=> How to solve recursion problems?
    -   Recursion = Principle of mathematical induction
    -   Steps to solve recursion Problems:
            1) Figure out the smallest case
            2) Always 'Assume' the sub-problem can be solved
            3) Solve the current problem assuming sub-problem's solution exists.

=> Pure Recursion : -
	-   For arrays, use methods like slice, spread, concat that make copies of arrays so you do 
        not mutate them. 

    -   Remember that strings are immutable so you will need to spread, slice, substr or substring 
        to make copies of strings.

    -   To make copies of objects use Object.assign or spread operator.
