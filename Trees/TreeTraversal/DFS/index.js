/*
===> Depth First Search(DFS):-
    ->  Depth-first search (DFS) is a tree or graph traversal algorithm that explores as 
        far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 
    ->  There are three common variations of DFS when applied to binary trees, which 
        determine the order in which nodes are visited. 
        These variations are:
        1) Pre-Order, 
        2) In-Order, 
        3) Post-Order traversals:
