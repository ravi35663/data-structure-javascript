    Why do we use bit-manipulation?
    -> It is perform action on bit level that is why it is very fast.
    
    ==> Bitwise Operators:
    1) Bitwise AND (&):
        0 & 0   => 0
        0 & 1   => 0
        1 & 0   => 0
        1 & 1   => 1
    2) Bitwise OR (|):
        0 | 0   => 0
        0 | 1   => 1
        1 | 0   => 1
        1 | 1   => 1
    3) Bitwise XOR (^) (Exclusive OR):
        0 ^ 0   => 0
        0 ^ 1   => 1
        1 ^ 0   => 1
        1 ^ 1   => 0
    4) Bitwise NOT (~) (1's complement):
        ~0  => -1
        ~1  => -2
        ~(integer) => - (integer + 1)
        => Explanation :
            let a = 0 ==> binary of 0 => 00000000 (upto 8)
                ~a = ~0 ==> take 1's complement of 0
                k =  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 (upto 32) -> here first bit is sign bit
                let 2's complements of magnitude of k (without sign bit which is 1)
                sign of 1 is (-)
                sign of 0 is (+)
                1(sign-bit) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                                      + 1
                        -----------------
                        -   0 0 0 0 0 0 1
                        -----------------
                                        -1

    5) Bitwise RightShift (>>):
        a>>b ==> (a/(2^b)) -> shift b bits in a toward right. that is discart bit from right and add in left
        5 >> 2 ==> 00000101 => 00000001 => which is 1
    6) Bitwise LeftShift (<<)
        a<<b ==> (a*(2^b)) -> shift b bits in a toward left. that is discart bit from left and add in right
                5 >> 2 ==> 00000101 => 00010100 => which is 20
