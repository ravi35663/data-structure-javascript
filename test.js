/*
===> Housing:
    Along one side of a road there is a sequence of vacant plots of land. Each plot has a different area 
    (non-zero). So, the areas form a sequence A[1], A[2], ... A[N].

    You want to buy K acres of land to build a house. You want to find all segments of contiguous plots 
    (i.e., a subsection in the sequence) of whose sum is exactly K.

    Plots = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2]
    K = 8

    Sample Output
    s  e 
    2  5 
    4  6
    5  9
