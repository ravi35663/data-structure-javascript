/*
===> Stack :-
    -> Stack is an abstract data structure.
    -> Stack is a LIFO(Last In First Out) data structure.
    -> Stack is just a concept.
    -> push and pop in the stack should be in constant time.
    -> Stack always prioritizes push and pop which is in constant time.
    -> Stack is used to add data 'in' and remove data 'out'.
*/ 
/*
==> Where to use Stack:
    -> Undo/Redu
    -> Routing(the history object) is treated as a stack.
    -> Function Call Stack in Programming:
    -> Expression Evaluation and Parsing:
    -> Parentheses Matching:
    -> Reversing Words or Strings:
    -> Backtracking Algorithms
    -> Textbook/Plate Stacking:
    -> Undo in Graphics and Design Software:
    -> Memory Management in Recursion:
    -> ....etc.

==> Using Stack with Array :-
    ->  If you add an element at the end of an array then you should remove the element 
        from at the end.
    ->  If you add an element at the start of the array then you should remove the element 
        at the start .
        i.e. (pushing and popping from the end)
        let stack = [];
        stack.push(10); //[10]
        stack.push(12); //[10,12]
        stack.pop(); // [10]
        stack.pop(); // []

	i.e. (pushing and popping from the start)
	let stack = [];
	stack.unshift(10); //[10]
	stack.unshift(12); //[10,12]
	stack.shift(); // [10]
	stack.shift(); // []

Note: Adding/removing element at beginning in array has more complexity than adding/removing
      from the end.

===> Big O of stack:
    -> Push : O(1)
    -> Pop: O(1)
    -> Access: O(N)
    -> Search: O(N)
*/ 
/*
==> Implementation: 
    -> You can implement stack using linked list and using array.
