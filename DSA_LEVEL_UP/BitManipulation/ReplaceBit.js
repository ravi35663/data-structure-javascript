/*
    Problem Statement:
    You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions i and j. 
    Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M 
    (i.e., insert the bits of M into N starting at bit i and ending at bit j).

    Example:
    N = 10000000000 (binary)
    M = 10101 (binary)
    i = 2, j = 6
    Output: 1001010100 (binary)
