/*
==> Digital Clock
    You are building a logic for a clock that requires you convert absolute time in minutes into a format 
    supported by a digital clock. See examples below.

    125 minutes can be displayed as 2:05
    155 minutes can be displayed as 2:35

    (You can assume the maximum value of minutes will be less than 24 X 60)

    Input
    Input is a single integer.
    1180
    Output
    Output is a string denoting the digital clock time.
    19:40

    Hint
    You can use the to_string(int)  method to convert an integer into string.

function digitalClock(input){
    const hour = Math.floor(input / 60);
    const minutes = input % 60
    return `${hour}:${minutes}`;
