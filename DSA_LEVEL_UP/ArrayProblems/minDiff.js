    Minimum Difference
    Implement a function that takes in two non-empty arrays of integers, finds the pair of numbers (one from each array) who absolute difference is closest to zero, and returns a pair containing these two numbers, with the first number from array. Only one such pair will exist for the test.

    Input
    Array1 = [23, 5, 10, 17, 30]
    Array2 = [26, 134, 135, 14, 19]
    Output

    17,19
