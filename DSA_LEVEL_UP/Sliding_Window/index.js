/*
===> Sliding Window:
    ->  Sliding window techique is useful for solving problems in array/strings, especially it is 
        considered as technique that could reduced the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n). 
*/

/*
===> Types of problems  :-
    1) Fixed window Length K:
        ->  The length of the window is fixed and it asks you to find something in the window as as the 
            maximum or median number of each window.
        ->  Usually we need kinds of variables to maintain the "state of the window" some are as simple 
            as a or it could be complecated as some advanced data structure such as list, queue or deque. 
    2) Two Pointers + Criteria :-
        ->  The window size is not fixed, usually it asks you to find the subarray that meets the criteria.
        ->  For example: given an array of integers, find the number of subarrays whose sume is equal to a target value.
