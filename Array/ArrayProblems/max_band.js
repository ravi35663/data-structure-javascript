/*
    Given an array containing N integers, find length of the longest band.
    A band is defined as subsequence which can be re-ordered in such a manner that all elements appears
    consequently (i.e. the absolute difference of 1 between neighboring elements)
    Here,
    A longest band is a band which contains maximum subsequence .
    const arr = [1,9,3,0,18,5,2,4,10,7,12,6];
    max_band = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]    which is 8

    Sol: you can solve it be sorting the arr but time complexity will be NLogN.
