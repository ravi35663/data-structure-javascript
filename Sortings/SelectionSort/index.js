/*
===> Selection Sort: -
    -> It is similar to bubble sort but instead of placing large values at sorted position it places small 
       values at sorted positions(first place).
    -> We pick minimum elements in the array and put that minimum element at the starting of the array and we 
       repeat these steps until all the sorted elements are sorted.
    -> Example: 
        arr = [4,1,5,7,8,0]
        1st -> [0,1,5,7,8,4]
        2nd -> [0,1,4,7,8,5]
        3rd -> [0,1,4,5,8,7]
        4th -> [0,1,2,4,5,7,8]  
    -> Time Complexity of Selection Sort. T.C = O(n^2) (n square)
    -> Selection sort is better than bubble sort because here it minimizes swaps.In bubble sort we swap over 
       and over and selection sort reduces this swaping.
