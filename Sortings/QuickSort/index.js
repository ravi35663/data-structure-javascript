===> Quick Sort:
    -> Quick sort is like merge sort, exploiting the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted.
    -> Work by selecting one element (Called pivot element) and finding the index where the pivot should end 
       up in the sorted array. i.e. one side of the array of pivot elements is less than the pivot element 
       and other side elements are greater than the pivot element.
    -> Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort is applied either side of the pivot.
    -> you can pick any element as a pivot element.
    -> arr = [3,9,0,7,1]
    -> Find pivot index:
    -> 1st iteration => [3,9,0,7,1] => Start iteration from index 1(because we have choose 3 as 
        pivot element) => [3,9,0,7,1]
    ->  2nd Iteration => index 2 => [3,9,0,7,1] => [3,0,9,7,1]
    ->  3nd Iteration => index 3 => [3,9,0,7,1] => [3,0,9,7,1]
    ->  4th Iteration => index 4 => [3,9,0,7,1] => [3,0,1,7,9]
    ->  final swap pivot element with pivot index => P.I= 2 => [3,0,1,7,9] => [1,0,3,7,9]
    -> Here 3 the pivot element is at a sorted position and we need to repeat this until all pivot elements 
       are sorted.
