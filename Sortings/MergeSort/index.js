/*
===> Merge Sort: - 
    -> Merge sort is combination of two thing: merging and sorting
    -> Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 and 1 element are always sorted
    -> Works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then build up  newly sorted 
       array.
    -> example : -
	    How does merge sort work? 
            arr = [8,3,5,4,7,6,1,2]
            Step1: divide array into two parts: [8,3,5,4] & [7,6,1,2] and again divide arrays into
                    two parts unless they are not broken into 1 element or 0 element array.
            -> [8,3] [5,4] [7,6] [1,2]
            -> [8] [3] [5] [4] [7] [6] [1] [2]
            Sort Arrays and merge them
            --> [3,8]  [4,5] [6,7] [1,2]
            --> Compare array elements and merge them
            --> [3,4,5,8]  & [1,2,6,7]
            Finally 
            -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
*/

/*
Note:
    -> log(n) decomposition of the array.
    -> n comparison per decomposition of the array. Hence T.C is (n Log(n)) 
    -> Space complexity is O(N) because we are introducing a new array.
