==> Sprting:
    -> Sorting is a process in which we re-arrange the elements in such a manner that items may be in either increasing order or 
       decreasing order(monotonic).
    -> e.g. sorting numbers or names alphabetically or objects based on any particular key..etc
    -> There are many sorting algorithms out there and all the sorting algorithms has their  own pros and cons.

===> Built-In Array sorting methods in Js: -
    ->  Default sorting is based on string unicodes not based on items we provide in an array.
    ->  We can tell “sort” how to sort items of an array by using the optional comparator function. This function sorts arrays 
        according to our need.
    -> this comparator function takes a pair of elements (a and b) and sorts based on return
    ->  arr.sort((a,b)=>{
		    return a-b;
        }) 
        value.
 	    -> If return -ve then a comes first than b
	    -> If return +ve then b comes first than a
	    -> If return 0 then any value comes
